    <p>
        The purpose of my game DogeSnake is to move the snake around and collect as many pellet as possible
        without touching the obstacle figure. In order to create the head of the snake, it involes a lot of different
        interaction between multiple sprites and as well as the colors of the object. During the process of creating
        this game, I ran into problems where the snake would not move because of the colors made the snake confuse,
        so I had to change the image and color of the snake.
