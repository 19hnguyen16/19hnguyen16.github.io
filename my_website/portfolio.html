                    The purpose of my game DogeSnake is to move the snake around and collect as many pellet as possible
                    without touching the obstacle figure. In order to create the head of the snake, it involes a lot of different
                    interaction between multiple sprites and as well as the colors of the object. During the process of creating
                    this game, I ran into problems where the snake would not move because of the colors made the snake confuse,
                    so I had to change the image and color of the snake.

                    At the start, I was just thinking of names for my characters, then I just go on from there. The plot of the story just continue on
                    and shift to different situation base on the choice that the reader choose. The hardest part about writing this story is putting
                    the words into code, the formatting and order that certain things have to go in. If I was to rewrite my story I would make it more
                    interesting by having a better plot. I could also make the decision points more difficult to decide on.
